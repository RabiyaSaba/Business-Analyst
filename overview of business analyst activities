OVERVIEW OF BA ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE

•	This chapter includes step by steps guidance for a BA over the course of an IT projects 
•	The book discussed about the question that the BA need to ask and can be used to help for the deliverables 
•	Discussed about BA tools and techniques 
•	Basically this is the diagram  to showcase the software development life cycle (noble path ) 

1.	INTIATION : make the business case of the projects , and proof of concepts , also need to discussed the user experience 

2.	The main aim of initiation phase is to develop the business case for  the projects

3.	The BA assist the project manager by identifying the stakeholder , business services and processes , by the end of the day key functionalities are identified 

4.	When non agile process is used we make use of change management 

WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE INTIATION PHASE 
1. Kick off meetings:  meeting to discuss main issue, cost, possible benefits and redo 
1.	Document required in kick-off : RFC ( request for change ) 

2.	Deliverables : pare to chart 	
3.	Cause and effects graphs 
4.	Cost and benefits analysis 
5.	Business impact analysis 


QUESTION TO BE ASKED 
 Related to opportunity, risk, health and benefits, how often the issue occurs etc. 


2. Identify the stakeholder:

RFC has been issued and triggering the projects 
Here we can create the high level RFC documentation 

QUESTION TO BE ASKED: 
Who will be affected due to success and failures, users, customers, and what is stakeholder interest 

3. BUSINESS IMPACT 
Analyse risk at start of each iteration, reassess regularly 
DOCUMENTS: 
Vision documents 
Business impact and analysis 
Proposed changes and business services (BRD) 

QUESTION: 
Threats, positive impacts, likelihood the error will occurs, best strategy 

4. REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT SETUP AND PLANNING 
Requirement traceability matrix, ump diagram, vision documents, overview documentation, business use case, etc. 

QUESTION 
Authors, responsibility, supports in the final products 

DESCRIBE USERS: 
Impact of business process workflow 
Documentation: 
Ump , did( data flow diagram ) , bpd( business process diagram ) ,CMS . Role map etc. 

REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT MONITOR: 
Static diagram, business concepts and rules 
Such as include ump: business perspective diagrams 
ERD (entity relationship diagram) 

DEFINE NON FUNCTIONAL BUSINESS SERVICES 
INVESTIGATE SOLUTION IN EARLY DESIGN 
QA PLANS 
REVIEWS AND SIGN OFF 

Rest is remaining need to read and make points 


DISCOVERY: architecture proof of concepts is delivered 
Understand the solution design and behaviour and create the base for architecture 
Proof of concepts are delivered in this phases 




•	CONSTRUCTION : complete the analysis and design phase , designing and coding appears In all the phases but peak in this phases 

•	FINAL V&V: this is final verification and validation. basically perform final testing before the product and services , testing occurs majorly in this phase but testing occurs throughout the phases 

•	CLOSEOUT : manage and coordinate deployment into production and close the IT projects
